# Personal Page

[My Personal Page](https://stephenachurra.com/) is a site I put together when I was fresh out of code school. I wanted to keep things simple so I went back to the basics with some good ol HTML/CSS/JS. I tried hand rolling all styles and functionality, but have referenced sources for a few of the tricks I borrowed.

## Features

- Hand rolled modals for project details
- Parallax scrolling on spacer images
  - Images are a few of my pictures from favorite places 
- Some responsiveness
- Analytics and tracking
- Hosted via Github Pages

## Borrowed Tricks
- Responsive HTML Timeline was used to build my timeline and was sourced from https://codepen.io/jplhomer/pen/lgfu.

## Future Implementations

- Improve responsiveness
- Sharpen and modernize style
- Could be fun to rebuild as a React app or to use a component library
